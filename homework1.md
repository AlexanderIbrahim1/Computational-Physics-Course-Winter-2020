# Homework 1

Homework for the module **Introduction to Julia and git**

The homework is due on **Friday, February 7, 2020**, via email
pointing me to your git repository.

Create a Julia package that solve a simple but non-trivial task. (For
example, the Julia package could be about handling sorted lists of
numbers, and could contain functions to generate sorted lists and to
merge sorted lists. You are free to choose any other task.)

I expect the following from this package:
- This is a complete Julia package that could be used in other projects
- It needs to be available in a public git repository, e.g. on Github
- It needs to have test cases that test non-trivial properties. The
  test cases need to pass.
- It needs to have a README file that provides outsiders with an
  overview over what the package does, including an example that is
  easy to understand and reproduce
- The git repository needs to have a licence

See for example [SIMD.jl](https://github.com/eschnett/SIMD.jl) for an
example of a complex, real-world package. (Your package can of course
be much simpler smaller.)

I will grade your package by reading the README, cloning (downloading)
it, and running the test cases. I will, of course, also look at the
source code.
