# Computational Physics

Lecturers: Erik Schnetter, Dustin Lang, several guest lecturers

Outline: This course is a practical introduction to computational
physics, mixing theoretical lectures and lab-based (programming) work.
The main topics will be:
- Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with examples from
  general relativity
- Linear algebra (matrix factorization) with examples from condensed
  matter physics
- Optimization (in particular convex optimization) with examples from
  quantum information
- Data analysis (image processing) with examples from astronomy

The course begins with an introduction to the Julia language and
related practices (e.g. version control, automated tests). It covers
also certain software technologies such multi-threaded, distributed,
or GPU programming.

Reference material: no textbook, although "Scientific Computing" by
Heath might be useful

Format: The course consists of six two-week modules; most can be
attended independently

Assessment mechanism: One lab assignment per module, pair work is
encouraged

Assessment type: pass/fail

Location: Time Room, Perimeter Institute

Time: Mondays 13:00 - 14:30 and Wednesdays 12:30 - 14:00

First Lecture: Monday Jan. 13, 2020
