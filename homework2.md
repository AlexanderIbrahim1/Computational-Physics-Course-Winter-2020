# Homework 2

Homework for the module **Differential equations**

Create a Julia package that solves the scalar wave equation in 1+1
dimensions.

You will need to
- choose a domain (e.g. the unit interval [0, 1])
- choose a suitable discretization method (e.g. piecewise linear
  continuous functions) for this domain
- choose a formulation of the wave equation, i.e. a concrete set of
  evolved variable ("state vector") and evolution equations for these
- define a suitable (conserved) energy
- choose suitable initial and boundary conditions
- implement this in Julia
- compare solutions at different resolutions and demonstrate
  convergence
- create a figure(s) so that others can understand your work
- present all the above in a git repository
