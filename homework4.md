# Homework 4

Homework for the module **Convex Optimization**

The homework is due on **Friday, April 3, 2020**, via email pointing
me to your git repository. (I can be flexible with the due date, but
am constrained by the date when I have to submit course results to the
university.) The homework was designed by Denis Rosset (email:
drosset@perimeterinstitute.ca, Skype: denisrosset, email before),
please contact him or me if you have questions.

The exercises are given at the end of the
"Step2_CausalStructures.ipynb" notebook in the "class-2020-03-11"
folder. Homework questions 1-3 require you to implement the linear
program that tests causal compatibility. You can choose which of the
homework questions in 4 you want to solve. I recommend solving the
first one if you're more happy with the theory of convex optimization,
while the second one will require to dig in the Julia language
(multidimensional arrays etc) -- if you build the M matrix by hand,
more power to you!

The literature references are given by hyperlinks in the same
notebook.
